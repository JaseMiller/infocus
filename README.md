# InFocus
HTML template for InFocus Newsletter for ITEAMS

## Moving from 2015 to 2017
The purpose of upgrades in early 2017 is to expand the ability for non-technical staff to curate, prepare and send content using the template and Mailchimp's standard tools. Although HTML editing will remain part of the feature set Mailchimp, the goal of upcoming changes is to make that feature unnecessary.
